  1. Its an ordered, sequence , mutable data type	1. Its an ordered, sequence , immutable data type

  2.Takes more time for excution			2.Takes less time for excution

  3.Consumes more memory				3.Consumes less memory

  4.Not able to use as an dictionary key		4.Able to use as an dictionary key

  5.We cannot generate hash values for list		5.We can generate hash values for list


2. Difference between mutable and immutable

   For immutable data type once the data created, their memory address never changed

   For mutable data type once the data created, their memory address will change once we edit the data
   
3. Difference between append and extend

  l = [1,2,3] if we want to add [4,5,6]

  diff btw append and extend

  append adds the elements at the end of the list with single index o/p l = [1,2,3,[4,5,6]]

  But extend will add the elements at different index for every element o/p l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
